# Butterworth Filter Design

## Problem Statement:
Noise is all around us and more often than not, noise interferes with the some of the beautiful sounds that we are trying to listen to and perhaps even record. Therefore, it is often desirable to be able to extract the unwanted sounds (noise) from the ones that we are interested in. Now, as complex as sound filtering and processing may seem, the two were made easy all thanks to some of the modern tools and software available to us. With that said, in order to be able to take advantage of these tools, one needs to have a good understanding of the ins and outs as well as the caveats of sound filtering, sampling, and processing both on theoretical and practical levels. Therefore, the purpose of this project is to allow myself to learn some of the common analysis and design techniques to solving two of the most practical filter design problems, designing lowpass and highpass filters. 

## Objectives:
The main objectives of this project were to take a deep dive into some of the common analysis and design techniques to solving two practical filter design problems as well as improve my theoretical and practical understanding of some of the concepts related to signals and systems sych as: Fourier Transforms, Filtering, and Sampling. To ensure the previously mentioned objectives are achieved, I decided to use MATLAB to design two types of Butterworth filters: a lowpass Butterworth filter and a highpass Butterworth filter. The lowpass Butterworth filter was used to eliminate the sound of a utility vehicle’s backup beeper from that of a great horned owl’s hoots whereas the highpass Butterworth filter was used to eliminate the sound of a flying jet from that of a number of birds chirping. With that said, the main challenge I set for myself was to design filters that are able to, effectively, eliminate the unwanted noise from the beautiful sounds of nature while still maintaining a minimal order. 

## Concluding Remarks:
In conclusion, my results turned out to be in line with the objectives I have set forth for myself for the purpose of this project. I was able to, completely, filter out the sound of a utility vehicle’s backup beeper from that of a great horned owl’s hoots using a 7th order lowpass Butterworth filter. Similarly, I was able to, completely, filter out the sound of a flying jet from the that of a group of birds chirping using an 8th order highpass Butterworth filter. Therefore, it is safe to claim that I was able to achieve the objective of eliminating the unwanted noises in the unfiltered sound files I have using the appropriate, minimal order Butterworth filters in addition to the signals and systems knowledge I have acquired throughout my education.
